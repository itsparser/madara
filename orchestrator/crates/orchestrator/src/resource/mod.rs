/// Resource trait
///
/// The Resource trait is used to define the interface for resources that can be used by the Orchestrator.
/// It provides a common interface for interacting with resources, such as databases, queues, and storage.
/// The trait is used to abstract away the specific implementation of the resource, allowing the Orchestrator
/// to work with a variety of resources without needing to know the specific details of each implementation.
/// The trait is also used to define the interface for mocking the resource, allowing the Orchestrator to
/// be tested in isolation without needing to set up a real resource.
